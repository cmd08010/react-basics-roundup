# React Basics Roundup

## Goals

- Separate existing html into components
- Replace repeated elements with react components via map
- Create objects to model UI data
- Use the useState API to store, read, update models

## Instructions

### Part 1

1. Clone this repo
2. The solution will be on the solution branch, the solution branch will be updated periodically during the live code-along so you can pull working code if necessary.

### Part 2

3. Break the existing UI elements into components
4. Create a data model to represent the repeated list elements (they will need to change color and display text)
5. Store the data at the display component level, Map the data model to display the list elements.
6. Move the data to a higher component (App) and pass it to the display component as props
7. Set the data into state and create an updating function using useState();
8. Pass state to the display
9. Create a mechanism for updating the color, red or green, of each list item's text on button click.

### Part 3

10. Create a function for creating new list items.
11. Make the function add new items to state
12. Capture the text-input value and on submit, update the list with the new item.
